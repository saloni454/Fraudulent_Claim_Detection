# Fraudulent_Claim_Detection

Problem Statement
Global Insure, a leading insurance company, processes thousands of claims annually. However, a significant percentage of these claims turn out to be fraudulent, resulting in considerable financial losses. The companyâ€™s current process for identifying fraudulent claims involves manual inspections, which is time-consuming and inefficient. Fraudulent claims are often detected too late in the process, after the company has already paid out significant amounts. Global Insure wants to improve its fraud detection process using data-driven insights to classify claims as fraudulent or legitimate early in the approval process. This would minimise financial losses and optimise the overall claims handling process.

Objective
Global Insure wants to build a model to classify insurance claims as either fraudulent or legitimate based on historical claim details and customer profiles. By using features like claim amounts, customer profiles and claim types, the company aims to predict which claims are likely to be fraudulent before they are approved.
